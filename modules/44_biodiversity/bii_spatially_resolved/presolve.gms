* smax() replaces the scalar check `s44_bii_target > 0` from bii_target.
* A guard is a condition that protects a code block from executing when it should not.
* Because i44_bii_target varies by (i,biome44), individual cells can be zero even when a policy
* is active (e.g. regions or biomes without a target). smax() checks whether any cell has a
* positive target, serving as the block-level guard before initialising the interpolation trajectory.
if (m_year(t) = s44_start_year AND smax((i,biome44), i44_bii_target(i,biome44)) > 0,
* The start value for the linear interpolation is the BII at biome level in the start year.
  p44_start_value(i,biome44) = v44_bii.l(i,biome44);
* The target value for the linear interpolation is the spatially resolved lower bound defined in `i44_bii_target(i,biome44)`.
* Replaces the uniform scalar s44_bii_target used in bii_target.
* Linear increase of BII target values at biome level from start year to target year, and constant values thereafter.
* The dollar operator acts as a cell-level guard: it restricts the interpolation assignment to only
* those (i,biome44) cells where a positive target has been set, skipping zero-target cells entirely.
* Without it, zero-target cells would produce a declining trajectory from p44_start_value toward zero,
* inadvertently imposing a downward BII pressure where no target was intended.
* This mirrors the role of the scalar guard `s44_bii_target > 0` in bii_target, which skips the
* entire block when no target is set -- here we need the check at the individual cell level instead.
